Basic idea "show your best foto" contest
- social app for users to upload their "best" fotos to share and allow other
  users vote on them in an ongoing foto contest
  
  
Home page
- carousel of the current top 3-5 voted fotos from amongst all users submissions
- join link
- login link
- ?? what else if anything can a visitor do without logging in ??

Join page (create a new user)
- login form and set up basic profile

========================
Once logged in User can
========================

Profile page
- view/edit profile info
- add/edit captions to their current fotos
- add/delete/replace their own fotos

Browse page 
- all users fotos page (overview with smaller images)
- select a specific foto to get better/larger view, show captions, comments? vote count?
- upvote a foto

(WBNI)Recently submitted page
- based on what criteria?
    - last day/week/month
    - last login by this user?
    - allow user to specify?

Some rules/assumptions
1) a given user can only vote for a given foto once
2) no user votes for their own fotos (assumes everyone would vote for their own
   or they would not have posted so those votes all cancel each other)
3) a user could vote for every foto on the site that isn't their own, but why?
4) a given user can have 5-10 fotos of theirs at a time .... if one of them is
   not getting upvoted enough than they may want to replace it
5) anytime a foto gets a new vote, immediately check to see if it has enough votes to 
    replace one of the current top 5
6) fotos in the current top 3-5 may continue to receive votes

   
Some questions
1) other than seeing the current top 3-5 and joining, should visitor be able to 
   do anything else? (maybe...see recently submitted)
2) how would I keep a user from voting for the same foto multiple times?
3) allow users to comment on others fotos?
4) in general, do I want to hide or show the userNames for fotos?
5) how do I efficiently find the 3-5 highest voted fotos to populate the carousel at initial
    load?
6) do I (need) to have any partial views on a given page??

basic architecture
- separate controllers for each "page"
- "shared" factory that holds the array of user objects and their current fotos
    - for now, factory will have some prepopulated users and images with votes
