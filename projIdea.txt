Basic idea ongoing "show your best foto" contest
- social app for users to upload their "best" fotos to share and allow other
  users vote on them in an ongoing foto contest
  
  
Home page
- carousel of the current top 3-5 voted fotos from amongst all users submissions
- join link
- login link
- ?? what else if anything can a visitor do without logging in ??

Join page (create a new user)
- new user form and set up basic profile

==============================================
Once logged in a User can see/do the following
==============================================

User Profile page
- view/edit your profile info
- add/edit captions to your current fotos
- add/delete/replace your own fotos

Browse page 
- all users fotos page (overview with smaller images)
- select a specific foto to get better/larger view, show captions, comments? vote count?
- upvote a foto

(WBNI)Recently submitted page
- based on what criteria?
    - last day/week/month
    - last login by this user?
    - allow user to specify?

Some rules/assumptions
1) a given user can only vote for a given foto once
2) no user votes for their own fotos (assumes everyone would vote for their own
   or they would not have posted that foto in the first place so those votes all 
   cancel each other)
3) a user could vote for every foto on the site that isn't their own, but why would they?
4) a given user can have max of 5-10 fotos of theirs up at a time .... if one of them is
   not getting upvoted enough than they can choose to replace it
5) anytime a foto gets a new vote, immediately check to see if it has enough votes to 
    replace one of the current top 5. This seems cleaner than some time interval check since
    the only time this would change is if some user casts a new vote....except when an image
    gets deleted....so need to make sure and cover that as well
6) fotos in the current top 3-5 may continue to receive votes
7) for now, adding a foto will expect all user's to grab a foto from the same
    single folder on my machine that has a big pool of pre-populated images
8) for midterm, not going to go to special lengths to protect user login data

   
Some questions
1) other than seeing the current top 3-5 and joining, should visitor be able to 
   do anything else without logging in ? (maybe...like view recently submitted?)
2) how would I keep a user from voting for the same foto multiple times?
3) allow users to comment on others fotos?
4) in general, do I want to hide or show the users for fotos? (might be cleaner voting 
    without knowing who submitted?)....but users are going to want credit for their fotos...
    so probably best to show users
5) how do I efficiently find the 3-5 highest voted fotos to populate the carousel at initial
    load?
6) do I (need) to have any partial views on a given page??
7) does/should fotoCarousel live in factory too or is that just something that gets created/updated
    when that page active

basic architecture
- separate controllers for each "page"
- "shared" factory that holds the array of user and their objects and their current fotos
    - for now, factory will have some prepopulated users and images with votes

objects
- user (username, password, contactInfo?, array of fotoObjects)
- fotoObjects(username, img, caption, voteCount, comments?)
- fotoCarousel( array of fotoObjects)...with the X highest vote counts
